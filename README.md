## Project Overview

The name "Hudhud" (ŸáÿØŸáÿØ) refers to the hoopoe, a bird significant in Arabian folklore, symbolising wisdom and the transmission of knowledge. The platform serves as a bridge connecting modern researchers with ancient inscriptions, facilitating the discovery and sharing of the rich epigraphic heritage of pre-Islamic Arabia.

The epigraphic data in Hudhud is provided by the Digital Archive for the Study of pre-Islamic Arabian Inscriptions (DASI), developed by the University of Pisa and CNR (Italian National Research Council).

Hudhud aims to build upon DASI and aid exploration by implementing advanced search capabilities, data analysis and visualisation, interactive mapping, AI-powered Q&A and tools for comparing and connecting related inscriptions.

## Features

- **Advanced Search:** Search within inscription text, translations, notes, bibliography, and more.
- **Detailed Records:** Access comprehensive information about each inscription, including images, translations, cultural notes, and bibliographic references.
- **AI Q&A:** Ask Hudhud questions about Ancient South Arabian history and inscriptions, powered by AI.
- **Semantic Markers:** View highlighted and annotate key terms, names, and concepts within inscriptions.
- **Similarity Analysis:** Discover and compare related inscriptions using text and metadata similarity.
- **Geographic Mapping:** Explore artifacts in their geographical context with interactive maps.

**Note:** Development is ongoing. More features will be added soon!
